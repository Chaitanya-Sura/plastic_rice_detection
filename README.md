# plastic_rice_detection
A system that detects plastic rice in both raw and cooked forms using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). It analyzes high-resolution images, extracting features like texture, shape, and color for raw rice, and swelling patterns for cooked rice. CNNs and traditional ML algorithms are used for accurate classification.
